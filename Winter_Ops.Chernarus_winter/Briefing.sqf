Your mission is to locate and retrieve HVT's during a heavy snowstorm on Chernarus.<br/>
The area is considered very hostile and from what our satelites could tell us due to the thick cloudcover is as follows:.<br/>
Infantry density:  medium to high.<br/>
Vehicle density:  light armor on the coast but possible heavier armor located inland.<br/>
You have been provided 2 HMMWV GPK's that act as medical vehicles giving your team the ability to use PAK's<br/>
Keep an eye on the task updates and prepare for low to medium visibility engagements.<br/>
<br/>
Each member of the team is capable of doing repairs on a vehicle if they have a toolkit.<br/>
Each HMMWV contains 1 toolkit and they Engineer class have a 2x efficiency bonus.<br/>

<br/>
Medical Info:<br/>
- The Personal Aid Kit can only be used in the Humvees and by anyone.<br/>
- The patient does not have to be stabilized when applying the PAK inside the vehicle (no bandaging needed, but a tourniquet helps if the patient is bleeding alot.).<br/>
- Outside the vehicle only bloodbag, morphine, epi combination will get the patient back up.<br/>
- Bloodbags get applied over time, check your medical menu for more info (hotkey H). Ask in-game if you dont have your medical menu.<br/>
- After having applied 1 or 2 bloodbags and the patient is still in alot of pain, apply 1 or 2 morphine (check pain after 1) before applying the epipen<br/>
